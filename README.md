### About 

This repository contains a bunch of beginner friendly projects that I am making while learning javascript. I've tried using the latest ES6 Javascript features while developing these projects. I try to update this repo regularly. Though all the projects are device responsive, I highly recommend viewing them on a desktop for a better experience. Also, for some examples make use of console.log() to enhance understanding.

###  What's in store for you?

If you are a beginner starting your journey in javascript you can just play around with the projects, understand their working and try making/re-developing them via your own approaches and algorithms.

#### Contribution is fun! ðŸ’š

If you already have had some experience with the language and have some projects to contribute, you're most welcome. You can always submit a Pull Request (PR) and get them merged.



###  What's coming next?

I'll be adding more projects related to Web-App development.
